I Wanna Be the Java Engine: an "I Wanna Be The Guy" Engine developed in Java!
By Klazen108
Released under the LGPL

This library is intended to be linked to your java project, and provides a starting point for game development.
If you're familiar with Game Maker, then this engine should be easy to pick up!

This engine is still under development. If you'd like to contact me about this project, you can reach out to me on the Wannabes Community Forums: http://www.iwannacommunity.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=1540
